In this program, we generate a letter by using the letters that came before it, as well as the country of origin. To do this, we first encode the country of origin as a one hot tensor and pass it through a linear layer, along with the previous letters. We then combine the hidden state with the output and apply another linear layer, followed by a dropout function. Each word is represented as a tensor of one hot encoder vectors for all possible letters, including small and capital letters, as well as punctuation. During each iteration (or epoch), the model is trained on a single name and tries to predict each subsequent letter based on the hidden state and the country of origin. Initially, we used 10,000 iterations, but found that the generated names were too far from real names, so we doubled the number of iterations to 20,000 and also doubled the size of the hidden state to 256.
